<h1>Greetings, <span class="username"><%= @user %></span></h1>

<div class="container-fluid">
  <p>
    If you're here, it's because you are having a problem with
    Audience1st that cannot otherwise be resolved, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Whoops" error no matter which screen you try to access or
      which customer you try to view</li>
    <li>Screens are unresponsive or giving error messages that don't
      make sense</li>
    <li>You're unable to get to one or more Audience1st screens at
      all (error message or hang forever when you try)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you haven't already tried the following, do so before trying
    this:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Make sure the problem is specific to Audience1st, i.e. you
      can still get to other Web sites without difficulty</li>
    <li> Make sure the problem is pervasive throughout Audience1st,
      as opposed to being limited to a specific customer or a
      specific action</li>
    <li>Log out and then log back in to Audience1st</li>
    <li>Try removing/clear the "browser cookies" related to
      Audience1st.  You can either remove all cookies, or if you
      remove specific ones, remove all cookies that have
      "audience1st" somewhere in the name.

  <p> Restarting "gratuitously" doesn't cause any damage, but it will
  immediately make the system unavailable for 3-5 minutes for both
  Altarena and CCCT while the restart completes.</p>

<h1>So you need to reboot...</h1>
<div class="container-fluid">
  <p>
    If, after reading the above, you want to restart Audience1st,
    click the Big Red Button below.  </p>
  If you don't want to do that,
    just close this browser window and nothing will be restarted.

  <form id="reboot" action="/reboot" method="post">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger">Restart <%= @server %> Server</button>
  </form>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    $(function() {
      $('#reboot').submit(function() {
        return(confirm("After a successful restart, it will take about 3 minutes before Audience1st is responsive again, so don't panic.  OK to attempt restart?"));
        });
    });
